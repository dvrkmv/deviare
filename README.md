# Deviare 

URL Shortener built using Node, Express, Mongo and Angular. Mainly as a learning experiment.

## Todo

* âˆš Check if short URL exists before assigning it

* (Not sure) Check if long URL exists and if so, don't assign it a new URL (? maybe, tracking?)

* Setup click count

* Fix view "click" to delete
